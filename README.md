# CognitoCurtain
CognitoCurtain is an application designed to enhance cognitive focus by dynamically managing the visibility of windows on multiple monitors. Inspired by FÃ©lix Guattari's concepts of cognitive attention, the app dims inactive windows to minimize distractions while keeping the active window clearly visible.
